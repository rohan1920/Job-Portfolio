# ðŸ§¾ About This Portfolio

This portfolio is a representation of my work as a full stack and AI developer. It has been created to showcase the key projects Iâ€™ve built, the technologies Iâ€™ve worked with, and the areas I specialize in.

It is designed to highlight my skills in modern web development (React, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS) and AI systems development (using OpenAI SDK, LangGraph, and Python). Through this portfolio, you can explore how I approach real-world problems and build practical, scalable solutions.

Each project listed here reflects my interest in innovation, clean code, and user-first design.

Whether youâ€™re a recruiter, collaborator, or just exploring â€” welcome to my developer journey.
